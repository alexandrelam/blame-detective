<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Blame Detective offers a range of powerful features to streamline the bug tracking and debugging process. Here are some examples of how you can effectively use the application:

### Example 1: Tracking Bug Introduction by Analyzing Modified Files within a Date Range

Specify the desired date range within Blame Detective to focus on specific periods of time.

Blame Detective will analyze the modification timestamps of your project files and display a comprehensive list of files that were modified within the specified range.

Review the list of modified files to identify potential candidates responsible for introducing bugs during that timeframe.

### Example 2: Conducting Advanced Text Searches

Utilize the powerful text search functionality provided by Blame Detective to locate specific code snippets or lines related to a bug.

Enter relevant search terms or apply regular expressions to narrow down your search to specific lines, functions, or variables.

Blame Detective will display the files that contain the matching text, allowing you to focus your attention on those specific code sections for bug investigation and resolution.

### Example 3: Including and Excluding Files with Regular Expressions

Leverage the flexibility of regular expressions within Blame Detective to include or exclude specific files from analysis.

Craft custom regular expressions to precisely target the files that need to be analyzed, saving time and effort.

Refine your bug tracking efforts by excluding irrelevant files or narrowing down the search to a specific subset of files based on their names or paths.
