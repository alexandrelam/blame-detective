              <li>
                Ensured that all required parameters are necessary for launching

                Git Diff Enhancements: We have added a highly requested feature
                that allows you to easily navigate and analyze changes in your
                Git repositories. When performing a regex text search, the app
                now highlights the lines in the Git diff that match your search
                criteria. This makes it even more convenient to track specific
                changes within your codebase.
              </li>
              <li>
                Stay Up-to-Date: We understand the importance of keeping our
                users informed about new releases and exciting updates. To
                achieve this, we have introduced a new patch note component.
                This component will provide you with timely information about
                the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes in each
                release. Now, you can stay up to date with the app's progress
                and never miss out on any important announcements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved Calendar Input Validation: Our calendar feature now
                includes enhanced validation to ensure accurate and logical date
                selection. We have implemented a validation mechanism that
                prevents users from choosing a second date that falls in the
                past. This enhancement eliminates any confusion or unintended
                selections, making the calendar input more intuitive and
                error-free.

                Default Theme Stability: We have addressed an issue that caused
                the default theme to malfunction when launching the app for the
                first time. The bug has been fixed, ensuring a seamless and
                visually pleasing experience right from the start.
              </li>
              <li>
                React Icons Warning Resolved: We have resolved a warning related
                to the usage of icons in React. This fix eliminates any
                potential issues or conflicts that may have occurred, resulting
                in a smoother and error-free app performance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved Context Organization: In our ongoing efforts to improve
                code structure and maintainability, we have moved the context to
                their own dedicated folder. This reorganization enhances the
                clarity and organization of the app's architecture, making it
                easier for developers to navigate and maintain the codebase.
