            Git Diff Enhancements: We have added a highly requested feature that
            allows you to easily navigate and analyze changes in your Git
            repositories. When performing a regex text search, the app now
            highlights the lines in the Git diff that match your search
            criteria. This makes it even more convenient to track specific
            changes within your codebase.

          <li>
            Stay Up-to-Date: We understand the importance of keeping our users
            informed about new releases and exciting updates. To achieve this,
            we have introduced a new patch note component. This component will
            provide you with timely information about the latest features,
            improvements, and bug fixes in each release. Now, you can stay up to
            date with the app's progress and never miss out on any important
            announcements.

            Improved Calendar Input Validation: Our calendar feature now
            includes enhanced validation to ensure accurate and logical date
            selection. We have implemented a validation mechanism that prevents
            users from choosing a second date that falls in the past. This
            enhancement eliminates any confusion or unintended selections,
            making the calendar input more intuitive and error-free.

            Default Theme Stability: We have addressed an issue that caused the
            default theme to malfunction when launching the app for the first
            time. The bug has been fixed, ensuring a seamless and visually
            pleasing experience right from the start.

          <li>
            React Icons Warning Resolved: We have resolved a warning related to
            the usage of icons in React. This fix eliminates any potential
            issues or conflicts that may have occurred, resulting in a smoother
            and error-free app performance.

          <li>
            Improved Context Organization: In our ongoing efforts to improve
            code structure and maintainability, we have moved the context to
            their own dedicated folder. This reorganization enhances the clarity
            and organization of the app's architecture, making it easier for
            developers to navigate and maintain the codebase.
